Could you please clarify what you mean by "I see //"?

After commenting out the `<Welcome />` component in `src/App.tsx` as instructed:

*   Are you now able to see the `Navbar`?
*   Are you able to see the word "Terminal" (rendered by the `<Terminal />` component)?

Your feedback will help me understand the current state and provide the next steps.
